# The connection contract

What a client learns when it connects to this server, and how the server keeps a
stale build from answering as if it were current. Two topics, one subject: the
process on the other end of the pipe, and whether you can trust what it says.

## Two eras on one pipe

This server is **dual-era**. One process serves MCP revision **2026-07-28** and
the `initialize` handshake that revision replaced, and it picks which from how
the client opens rather than from configuration. The specification provides for
that arrangement by name.

- A request carrying `params._meta` with
  `io.modelcontextprotocol/protocolVersion` is **modern**. There is no session:
  each request is accepted or refused on the version it declares.
- An `initialize` puts the process in the **legacy** era for the rest of its
  life — the scope the specification gives a stdio server. After that, requests
  carry no version of their own, because a client that old never learned to send
  one.

### `server/discover`

`server/discover` answers what this server is — supported versions,
capabilities, identity and `instructions` — in one round trip, replacing what
the handshake used to carry.

It is the one request never refused over its version. A client asks it precisely
when it does not yet know what to speak, so refusing it for asking would close
the loop it exists to open.

It offers only the modern revision, since that is what a request's `_meta` may
name. The handshake versions are a different door, not another item on this
list.

A modern request naming a version this build does not implement is refused with
`UnsupportedProtocolVersionError` (`-32022`). Its `data` carries both what was
asked for and what exists — with no handshake to renegotiate in, that is the
client's whole means of recovery.

### Fields a result must carry

Every modern result carries `resultType`. The two results a client may cache —
`tools/list` and `server/discover` — carry `ttlMs` and `cacheScope` as well.

The revision requires both, and a client that does not get them discards the
answer while the connection still looks healthy. That, not the era, is what made
the Planning tools vanish from Claude Code twice. A legacy answer carries
neither, because those revisions never defined them.

### When the legacy door closes

It stays open for clients that have not moved. That is no longer known to
include Claude Code — a wire capture shows it opening with `server/discover`.

The door closes when nothing knocks on it, and that is established by recording
what a client actually sends, not by reading its changelog.

### Tools

Every tool carries a `title`, a description, a JSON Schema, and MCP behaviour
`annotations`. There are three sets:

| Set | `readOnlyHint` | `destructiveHint` | `idempotentHint` | Tools |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| read-only | `true` | — | `true` | the nine reading tools: `list_planning_spaces`, `get_planning_space`, `get_work_item`, `list_work_items`, `search_work_items`, `list_platform_modules`, `list_improvement_cases`, `get_improvement_case`, `get_improvements_profile` |
| writing | `false` | `false` | — | everything else |
| destructive | `false` | `true` | — | `delete_work_item` |

`openWorldHint` is `false` throughout, because nothing here leaves the machine.

Prompts and resources are deliberately not offered. Planning tools manage work;
project context belongs elsewhere.

### Server identity

The `serverInfo` in the discovery result reports version `1.0.0+<build>`, where
the build is the first twelve hex characters of a digest over the modules the
process started with.

The release number alone was a literal that had never moved, so two servers from
different checkouts introduced themselves identically.

## Running one version against another's data

A stdio MCP server is spawned by its client from a working tree, and lives as
long as the session does. Nothing makes it exit when that tree changes.

So pulling a change gives the *next* session a process built from the new code
while the current one keeps answering from the old — both against the same
store. No automatic update can fix this: the client owns the process, and a
server that killed itself mid-call would lose the call rather than repair
anything.

Two guards make the skew impossible to miss instead.

### A process that went stale while it ran

`static_assets.SourceWatch` covers this case. Every tool result from such a
process carries an extra content block saying so and naming the one fix:
restart the client session.

It is appended, never prepended — `content[0]` stays the payload.

The check is two signals, so it can be asked on every call. A stat-only stamp
says something *may* have happened; only then are the modules read to see
whether anything did. A `git checkout` that restores identical bytes is
therefore not reported as a change.

Drift is one-way. A process cannot become current again.

### A build that was already old when it started

`store.STORE_SCHEMA_VERSION` covers the opposite case: a checkout moved back, an
installed copy left behind.

The generation lives in `PRAGMA user_version` — the improvements database keeps
its own, in its own file — and is read before the first write of any kind,
including the schema script. A store written by a newer build raises
`StoreTooNew` and is not touched.

Raise the number in the same commit that changes what an existing row *means*.
Migrations here are forward-only and idempotent, so it is the change of meaning,
not an added column, that this exists to stop.
